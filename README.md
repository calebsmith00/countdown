# Prerequisites

To install/run this development server, you will need to install NodeJS LTS and you will need access to a command prompt or terminal.

# Getting Started

First, you will need to download the required modules:

npm install

# Next, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

# TODO

- Style the 'change goal date' page
- Style the calendar
- Look into asynchronous functionality as, when you first load the page, there is a slight hiccup until it shows you the proper countdown
